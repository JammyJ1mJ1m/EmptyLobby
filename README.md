# GTA V Lobby Emptier
The main goal of this program is to freeze a copy of GTA V for a set amount of seconds, causing you to timeout from the session and be placed in one on your own. The process name to look for is a hardcoded string, meaning it could be changed to any game with the same result.
The project is made using C# and as a result you may need `DOT NET 6.0` which is the framework used.

## Installing
The release builds of the project are an exe which can be run without an installer.

## Using
Simply run the exe when you are in a GTA Online session.

## Building
The project is a visual studio 2022 solution, which can just be opened through Visual Studio. It may work on older versions or other dot net versions, which some changes to the code. Assuming you are on the latest dot net and visual studio, it should open and compile with no problems.
